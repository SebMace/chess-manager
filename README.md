# chess-manager
A chess manager to organize your games and results.

A TDD Sandbox.

Together with **Valentina Jemuović (Cupać)** and her sister **Jelena Cupać**, I’m following a training program designed to help me develop a fully TDD-compliant application using **Chess Manager**. This project serves as a "sandbox" where I will apply and refine the best practices of **Software Craftsmanship**. Contributions are welcome, provided they strictly adhere to these principles.

## Why Chess Manager?

As a **French chess player**, I’ve observed a significant lack of tools for efficiently managing chess games, whether played in **club teams** or **individual tournaments**. **Chess Manager** aims to fill this gap.

### Features and Use Cases
- Are you a **club president** or **webmaster** who dreads manually recounting the results of each match and game after every round of the national championship?  
  **Chess Manager** simplifies this process.

- Would you like to track **Elo performance** for yourself or a club player over the course of a season?  
  **Chess Manager** has you covered.

- Need reliable, user-friendly tournament pairing software?  
  **Chess Manager** will be your friend!

### System Architecture Style

Frontend + Microservice Backend

**Note:** This project is a work in progress and serves as a practice ground for applying **Test Driven Development (TDD)** and **Software Craftsmanship principles**.

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure your pull requests strictly follow the project's guidelines for high-quality code.
